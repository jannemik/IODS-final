This repository includes my final assignment for the **Introduction to Open Data Science (IODS)**. It uses multiple correspondence analysis to examine whether secondary level students can be distinguished from each other based on their orientation towards school and orientation towards free time and relationships.

The final assignment is published [here](https://jannemik.github.io/IODS-final/).
